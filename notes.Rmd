Load in our required libraries for package development.

```{r}
library(devtools); library(roxygen2); library(testthat); library(knitr)
```

Create a function by either opening and saving an .R file in the R/ directory or use the function below.

```{r}
usethis::use_r("functionName")
```

Once we have created a function (or many), we need to load them into the "package environment".

```{r}
devtools::load_all()
```

Check your functions.

```{r}
devtools::check()
```

Create an .Rd file by opening up the source file and clicking Code>Insert Roxygen skeleton. Fill in the parts with the relevant information, then trigger the creation using the document function.

```{r}
devtools::document()
```

Declare your general intent to use some functions from a package.
```{r}
use_package("pkgName")
```
